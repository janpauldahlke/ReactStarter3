and where to embed middleware

TODO: create app
- AJAX to load listOfUsers
- render all user as tiles in app
- each tiles shows name, company and email<button>
- mail button allows to quick send mail via connected mail client

roadmap to TODO:
1. build app with dummy data
2. replace dummy data with AJAX
3. write middleware to fetch data
